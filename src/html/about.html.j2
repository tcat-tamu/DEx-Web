               <strong>DEx: A Database of Dramatic Extracts</strong> is an online, searchable database of extracts transcribed from seventeenth-century manuscripts and aims to provide much-needed information to textual editors, literary scholars, and cultural historians interested in theater history, audience reception, early modern print and manuscript culture, and the history of reading.

               Early modern readers and playgoers often kept commonplace books and miscellanies, where they would copy poems, aphorisms, letters, accounts, and any number of things&mdash;including selections from plays. <strong>DEx: A Database of Dramatic Extracts</strong> aids scholars in finding selections from plays copied into manuscripts. While contemporary readers often overlook lesser-known historical plays and playwrights, early modern readers did not make the same distinction.

               Extant manuscript evidence suggests the phenomenon of copy selections from English plays began around the 1590s; so DEx focuses on seventeenth-centry manuscripts. Although the practice continued in the Restoration, at the moment DEx catalogs only extracts from plays written and published before the closure of theaters in 1642.
